# AI-for-gamedev
- All the codes are work done by my friend and I as this course require us to work in a group and we decided to team up to complete it.
- Consist of materials for assignment under the subject of AI for game development.
- All the assignments here use AI and some even use different types of algorithm to play the game.
- Then, we analyzed the result for each game played by the AI agents and compare to see which AI agents play the game effectively depends on the use case we want to study.
